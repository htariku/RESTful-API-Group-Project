Boot Camp Project Group Agreements

1. 	What is your project about?
-   Our project is a sports blog where users can look up sports related articles and interact/engage with other users by commenting and/or liking each other’s posts

3. How often will you have meetings? How long?
-   We will meet on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at 5pm for 30min to an hour
4. How will you keep track of tasks?
-   Keep track of tasks using GitHub issues and with our own notes/checklists of what tasks we need to complete both individually and as a group prior to each meeting.
5. What if someone misses a deadline?
 - Communicate in advance if you’re not able to make a deadline so that the team can be prepared in advance and have time to find solutions. If the deadline is missed, we need to take time to plan how to catch up with due dates that were pre-set as a team.
7. What happens if someone misses a meeting? What is their responsibility? The team’s responsibility?
- If someone misses a meeting, we will check on that person to make sure the member is okay and their responsibilities will be re-communicated so that we as a team will not fall behind and can do our best to help that person if they have any missing work. We could also reschedule and meet up on other days where everyone is available, if needed
9. How does each team member like to receive feedback?
-   Open communication with all members, receiving direct feedback and being open to criticism
10.  What if there is friction between members? How will you address it? 
- Communicate with the members openly and try to resolve issues, if needed also communicate with TAs or instructor to come up with the best solution
